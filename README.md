# ARDUINO PROJECTS

This repository contains code for my electronic projects which are developed using several microcontrollers like 
(Raspberry Pi, Arduino, NodeMCU, etc.). 

### SMART_HOUSE
This particular file is the code of an IoT based smart house project developed by me. It uses Google Firebase as it's backend and the
source code for the app and website of the same project are available at http://github.com/sajjad006/iot-app and 
http://github.com/sajjad006/iot-website respectively. The user can control the variuos components of his/her house by the click of a button
from his smartphone. Not only that it also ensures the security of the house by a number of measures (refer http://iotinhouse.tk for more 
detail).

### SMART_HOUSE_ARDUINO
This is the source code for controlling the various offline functionalities of a smart house and in this case it is done by an Arduino UNO.
The garage door of the house will automatically open, when the car of the user comes in front of the house.

### LINE_FOLLOWING_ROBOT
This is the source code of a line following robot developed by me for my school's science exhibhition (2018). It uses an array of 8 IR 
sensors to distinguish between black and white path and follows the black bath. These type of robots has several real life uses. For more
